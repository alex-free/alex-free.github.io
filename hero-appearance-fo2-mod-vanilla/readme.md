# Hero Appearance Mod For Fallout 2 Vanilla

This is the [Hero Appearance Mod](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Hero_Appearance) for Fallout 2, but it doesn't require SFall or any unofficial patches. It has been tested on the 2002 Mac OS X PowerPC port of Fallout 2, Fallout 2 v1.0 (PC), and Fallout 2 v1.02d (PC).

## Important Information

* You can't "pick" your character appearance when you start the game. You will "pick" your character appearance by installing the mod to the right place, that will change your character (and any character that uses the default tribal female or male sprite).

* This is based off of the latest [Hero Appearance Mod v2.10](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Hero_Appearance/releases/tag/v2.10). It includes all cannon and non cannon appearances available for that release.
