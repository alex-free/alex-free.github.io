# [PowerPC Media Center 7 (PPCMC 7)](readme.md) -> Credits

Originally created by 'Hugh Downs' ('OpenSourceMac' of Macintosh Garden), PowerPC Media Center was in development for 6 years until the last final update. All versions 7.0 and above have been worked on by Alex Free. 

'Wicknix' of the MacRumors PPC forum is responsible for the Twitch.tv live stream support. 

'Wowfunhappy' of MacRumors PPC forum suggested a solution to make one FFMPEG work on G3's with AltiVec disabled but also on G4's and G5's with AltiVec enabled.

I am also very grateful for Thomas Bernard's SDL 2.0.3 patches for Mac OS X 10.4 PPC that I came across at https://gist.github.com/miniupnp/26d6e967570e5729a757 . I used the same changes but made new patch files for the SDL2 included within PPCMC.

I am also very grateful of all the PPC Mac contributors of MacPorts. Many MacPorts patches are now used in my custom build system.
