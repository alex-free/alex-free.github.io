---------------------------------------

## Usage

There are 2 different releases. 'Ready To Copy' is the complete starter pack in full. 'Downloader' only contains a script which downloads all the files from the internet.

1) Create a new offline profile on your Xbox 360 that will not use Xbox live.

2) Disconnect from the internet on your Xbox 360. If you have a wired ethernet connection, physically unplug the cord. If you have a WiFi connection, forget your WiFi network.

3) Disable auto-power off on your Xbox 360.

4) Format your USB drive using your Xbox 360.

5) Eject your USB drive from your Xbox 360.

6) Connect your USB drive to your computer.

7) Extract the latest 360 Hack Pack release.

8) If you are using the 'Ready To Copy' release, open the `files` directory in the extracted 360 Hack Pack release. Copy everything inside of `files` onto the root of your USB drive. Note: on Mac, the Finder does not allow a simple copy and paste because of the hidden `Content` folder. To work around this you can use the `360hp` command included in the 'Ready To Copy' release. The `360hp` command needs the path to your USB drive, i.e. `360hp /Volumes/NO\ NAME`. If you are using the 'Downloader' release, it is the same command.

9) Eject your USB drive from your computer.

10) Plug in your USB drive to your Xbox 360. If you are prompted to update the dashboard, do so. You should already disconnected from the internet so this will only show if you need to update your dash for BadUpdate, and it will pull the update from the USB drive. **DO NOT UPDATE VIA THE INTERNET IN CASE A NEW DASHBOARD UPDATE THAT PATCHES BADUPDATE COMES OUT!**

11) Launch Rock Band Blitz.

12) Press A.

## Additional Info

BadUpdate is not a 100% reliable exploit. If the music and animation on the title screen in Rock Band Blitz stops the exploit failed. When that happens turn off the console, turn on the console, and try again. You may or may not need to do this many times until it works as success is completely random.

Once BadUpdate brings you back to the dash board, you can connect to the internet because Xbox Live is blocked. Before turning off the console, you must disconnect from the internet however. If you have a wired ethernet connection, physically unplug the cord. If you have a WiFi connection, forget your WiFi network.
