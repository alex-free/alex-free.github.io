# [360 Hack Pack - The Ultimate Xbox 360 Starter Pack](readme.md) -> Changelog

## Version 1.0.1 (3/28/2025)

Changes:

* Now includes a build of Simple 360 Nand Flasher v1.5b (latest commit as of 3/27/2025) using the new Read Only target. The Read Only builds do not allow writing to the NAND, only dumping of it. This is specifically for BadUpdate consoles that can't write to NAND without bricking.
