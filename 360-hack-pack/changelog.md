# [360 Hack Pack - The Ultimate Xbox 360 Starter Pack](readme.md) -> Changelog

## Version 1.0.2 (4/7/2025)

Changes:

* Added the ability to use [XeUnshackle](https://github.com/Byrom90/XeUnshackle) or [FreeMyXe](https://github.com/FreeMyXe/FreeMyXe).

* XeUnshackle sets Aurora as your default launcher.

* Added [HDD Compat Partition Fixer (for original Xbox backwards compatibility)](https://consolemods.org/wiki/File:Hdd_compat_partition_fixer_v1.zip) v1.

* Added [Hacked Compatibility Files (for original Xbox backwards compatibility)](https://consolemods.org/wiki/Xbox_360:Original_Xbox_Games) 12-09-2019.

* Added [Xell-Reloaded](https://github.com/Free60Project/xell-reloaded) v0.993. This is setup on the FreeMyXe editions to allow it to be loaded immedietly after exploit as an option (rather then the stock NXE dashboard). On the XeUnshacked editions, Xell-Reloaded is at `apps\xell-reloaded-v0.993`. Note: Xell-Reloaded does not work on Xbox 360 E Winchester (it loads to a black screen, with no recourse other then to reboot the console and not use it when asked by FreeMyXe) so don't bother yet until this issue is [addressed](https://github.com/FreeMyXe/FreeMyXe/issues/14#issuecomment-2782039804) if your on an Xbox 360 E Winchester. Every other console revision works fine.

* Improved folder name conventions in `apps` folder.

* Downloader is more verbose on what it is doing.

* Creates a `backup` folder that you can place your important files (such as NAND flash backup, cpu key txt, etc.).

## Version 1.0.1 (3/28/2025)

Changes:

* Now includes a build of Simple 360 Nand Flasher v1.5b (latest commit as of 3/27/2025) using the new Read Only target. The Read Only builds do not allow writing to the NAND, only dumping of it. This is specifically for BadUpdate consoles that can't write to NAND without bricking.
